Either keep the number of dimensions intact (the first dimension has length 1):
array3d[:1, :, 2:]

array([[[ 2,  3,  4],
        [ 7,  8,  9],
        [12, 13, 14]]])

or reduce that dimension:
array3d[0, :, 2:]

array([[ 2,  3,  4],
       [ 7,  8,  9],
       [12, 13, 14]])

These are different answers to the question, but both are fine.
